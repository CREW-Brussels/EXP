# EXP
Embodied XR Performance Framework is a framework for creating immersive performances, mostly in Unreal Engine.
The documentation is still going under a bit of refinement to be as clear as glass, but all of the submodules created for this project are ready-to-use.
If you are bold enough to try it, we recommend Unreal Engine 5.3.


You can check our [WIKI](https://github.com/CREW-Brussels/EXP/wiki) or the README of each submodule for complete documentation.

It consists of:

## [1. CREW EXP Template](https://github.com/CREW-Brussels/CREWNetworkFramework)

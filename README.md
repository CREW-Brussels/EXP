# EXP
Embodied XR Performance Framework is a framework for creating immersive performances, mostly in Unreal Engine.
The framework is currently under heavy development and can be majorly refactored at any time.
If you are bold enough to try it, we recommend Unreal Engine 5.3.


You can check our [WIKI](https://github.com/CREW-Brussels/EXP/wiki) for complete documentation.

It consists of:

## CREW XR Template
